# Tranquilizer Gun
A custom weapon plugin for SCP:SL Smod2 servers that adds a tranquilizer gun. When a player is shot, they are temporarily ragdolled for the duration of the tranquilization. This gun has a configurable limited amount of uses and magazine size, as well as further configurations for weapon damage and fire rate.
